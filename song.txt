Hello, darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain,
Still remains,
Within the sound of silence.

In restless dreams I walked alone,
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
Neath the halo of a streetlamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp,
When my eyes were stabbed
By the flash of the neon light,
And split the night,
And touched the sound of silence.
